Let me mark the first move on GitHub.
First obstacle I have to overcome is that the dns problem. 2 ways to do this: drivers\etc\hosts and deploy a brand new google dns server.
Second thing is what I am doing now, write a README for my profile. It's interesting.
Then I will start to explore the github by repos step by step. Good luck.
